# vim-profile
A collection of dot files that have been crammed into my .vim directory and symlinked out. 

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/elstevi/vim-profile.git ~/.vim
sh ~/.vim/setup.sh

## Updates
By default (when using bash) this will automatically prompt you if there are updates available on github and help you install them. If you do not want this, simply touch the file `~/.vim/no\_update`.
